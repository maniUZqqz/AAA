/**
 * Carries the plan a visitor picked on the public site through signup.
 *
 * The marketing site links to `/register?plan=pro`, but a subscription hangs
 * off a *store*, and a store does not exist until after registration. So the
 * choice has to survive two navigations. Before this existed the parameter was
 * simply dropped: someone clicked "حرفه‌ای" on the pricing page and landed on a
 * blank form with no memory of what they chose.
 *
 * sessionStorage, not localStorage: the intent belongs to this visit. Coming
 * back a week later and silently getting a plan you picked once would be
 * surprising in the wrong direction.
