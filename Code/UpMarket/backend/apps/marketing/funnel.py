"""The funnel, computed from real events.

The marketing spec asks a specific question:

    Visitor → Landing Page → Feature/Solution → Pricing → Signup → Customer

Counting events is not enough to answer it — 500 pricing views could be five
people refreshing. So every step counts **distinct sessions**, not events.

What this deliberately does *not* do is force each step to be a subset of the
one before. Picking a plan is genuinely optional — the register button on most
pages carries no plan — so a strict chain would drop real signups and report
zero. Optional steps are marked, and drop-off is measured against the last
required step. If an event is missing the report shows the gap rather than
smoothing it over.

Nothing here is estimated or modelled. If a number cannot be derived from
stored events it is not reported.
