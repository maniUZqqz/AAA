"""Leads from the public website.

A Lead is platform-level, not store-level: it arrives before the person has an
account, so it cannot hang off a Store the way Notification does. It belongs to
*us*, and it is read in the Django admin.

Deliberately minimal. The contact form asks for as little as it can get away
with — every extra required field costs conversions — so most columns are
optional and the serializer enforces only what is genuinely needed.
