"""Bank transfer, confirmed by a human.

This is what the business does today: the customer transfers money and someone
checks. Modelling it as a provider rather than leaving it outside the system
matters, because it means a manually-paid subscription goes through the same
activation path, produces the same invoice, and lands in the same transaction
history as a gateway payment. Reconciliation later is then one table, not two.

`automatic = False` is the whole point: `verify()` never returns paid on its
own. Somebody in the admin has to say so, and that action is recorded with
their name.
