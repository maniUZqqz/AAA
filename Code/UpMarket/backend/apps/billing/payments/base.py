"""Payment gateway abstraction.

Every Iranian gateway this product is likely to use — ZarinPal, IDPay,
NextPay, Zibal — has the same three-step shape:

    request()  ask the gateway for a token, get back a URL to send the user to
    (user leaves the site, pays, comes back)
    verify()   ask the gateway whether that token was actually paid

So the rest of the codebase talks to this interface and never names a vendor.
Switching gateway is a settings change plus one new file here.

Two rules that matter more than the shape:

1. **Amounts are in Toman everywhere inside this project.** Several gateways
   want Rial, which is exactly ten times larger. That conversion lives in the
   provider that needs it and nowhere else — a 10× billing error is the kind of
   bug that only shows up in production, on a real customer's card.

2. **Verification is server-to-server.** The browser comes back from the
   gateway carrying a status, and that status is a hint, not evidence. Nothing
   is marked paid until the gateway itself confirms it over an API call we
   made.
