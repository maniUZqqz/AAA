"""Quality-gated credit: a store pays for output it can use, not for output.

ROADMAP §9.9 draws it as:

    Generation → QC → PASS: consume credit · FAIL: refund credit

`services.reserve/commit/release` already covers the crash case: a render that
dies releases its reservation. This module covers the harder one — the render
*succeeded*, the credit was spent, and the result is unusable anyway. Without
this, a store that regenerates a poster four times pays four times for one
poster, and concludes the product is expensive rather than that the model had
a bad day.

Two things are deliberately separated:

* **refund** — one specific output was rejected; its credit goes back.
* **guarantee** — after `QUALITY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` tries at the same thing, we stop
  charging for it at all and say so. That is a promise, so it is enforced in
  code rather than offered in marketing copy.

The `source` field exists because the automatic judge (Vision QC, phase 21) is
not built yet. Today every verdict comes from the shop owner pressing "not
good"; when QC arrives it writes `AUTO` into the same ledger and nothing else
has to change.
