"""Payments and the audit trail.

A `Payment` is one attempt, not one success. Failed and abandoned attempts are
kept on purpose: "why did this customer not subscribe" is answerable from the
row that says the gateway declined them, and unanswerable if we only store
what worked.

The same row is the invoice and the transaction-history entry. A separate
Invoice model would be a second source of truth for the same money, and those
drift.
