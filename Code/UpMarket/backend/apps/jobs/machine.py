"""The states a generation job may be in, and the moves between them.

Until now a Job was QUEUED → RUNNING → COMPLETED. That is enough for a caption
and useless for a video: the whole point of incremental generation (§9.1) is
that the job **stops** after the first five seconds and waits for a person, and
"RUNNING" cannot express the difference between "the GPU is busy" and "the GPU
is idle because we are waiting for you".

So the states carry that distinction, and the machine enforces it:

    QUEUED → PROCESSING → PREVIEW → WAITING_APPROVAL → APPROVED
           → RENDERING → QC → COMPLETED

Every state also reaches FAILED and CANCELLED, and nothing leaves those two.

Why a table rather than `if` statements scattered across the tasks: an illegal
move is not a display bug. A job that goes from WAITING_APPROVAL straight to
COMPLETED has charged a customer for something nobody approved, and a job that
re-enters RENDERING has spent GPU minutes twice. `advance()` refuses, loudly.

The legacy states (RUNNING) stay in the enum. Old rows exist, and rewriting
history to make a state diagram prettier is how you lose the ability to explain
an invoice from last month.
