"""
Detecting and reaping DEAD jobs.

A Job row is the only thing the frontend polls. If a worker (or the Django
process running the job synchronously) dies mid-task, the row stays
QUEUED/RUNNING forever and every panel that re-attaches to it shows an
infinite spinner and blocks its own button (beter.md v2 #1/#2 — a 33-hour-old
"در حال تحلیل…" that the user never started).

Nothing can rescue such a row, so it is marked FAILED as soon as anyone looks
at it. Two different clocks are used:

* RUNNING — the task reported progress at least once; it is dead only after
  longer than the slowest possible single AI call could take.
* QUEUED  — nobody ever picked it up. A worker takes a job in milliseconds, so
  a long QUEUED age means the queue is not being consumed at all.
