"""Picking a parked job back up after a person answered.

Kept apart from the approval endpoint on purpose. The endpoint knows that a
human said yes; only the pipeline knows what "carry on" means for this
particular job type, and wiring that knowledge into the view would make every
new job type a change to the HTTP layer.

A job type with no entry here parks and stays parked. That is the honest
behaviour: a state machine that silently completes jobs it does not know how to
resume would report success for work that never ran.
