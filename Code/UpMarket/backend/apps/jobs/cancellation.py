"""Cancelling a job for real, not just hiding its spinner.

The old cancel flipped the row to CANCELLED and stopped the polling. From the
panel that looks identical to this one; from the shop's side it is not. Four
things have to happen, and the old version did the first only:

1. the UI stops waiting,
2. half-written files stop occupying disk,
3. the GPU stops being held by a task nobody is waiting for,
4. **the credit comes back** — a render the owner abandoned after five seconds
   must not be billed as a finished video.

Point 4 is new because `apps.billing.credits` now exists. Before it, cancelling
quietly charged for nothing, which is the kind of thing a customer discovers on
their invoice rather than in a changelog.

Ordering matters: the credit is returned **before** the row goes terminal. If
the process dies between the two, a job stuck in a non-terminal state is
visible and fixable, whereas a CANCELLED job whose credit was never returned
looks finished and is silently wrong.
