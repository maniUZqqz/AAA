"""Recording how long each render actually took.

Phase 0.5 is the gate the whole roadmap waits behind, and its DoD is "a
benchmark report with real numbers exists". Right now the capacity model rests
on two remembered runs — 15 minutes and 45 minutes for five seconds of video —
and the gap between those two numbers is the gap between a viable business and
one that cannot reach its own break-even.

The benchmark cannot be run here: this machine has no GPU. What can be built
here is the part that makes the benchmark a by-product of ordinary use instead
of a separate exercise someone has to remember to write down. Every render
records what it cost, `manage.py benchmark` reports the distribution, and the
numbers stop being remembered.

Two deliberate choices:

* **Nothing is averaged across machines.** A 3060 and a 4090 produce different
  numbers, and their mean describes neither. Rows carry a hardware
  fingerprint and the report groups by it.
* **Failures are recorded too.** A pipeline that succeeds in 4 minutes but
  fails a third of the time costs 6 minutes per usable output, and a table of
  successful renders would hide that completely.
