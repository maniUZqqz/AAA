"""The store owner's own view of where their data goes, and their say in it.

A privacy setting the customer cannot read or change is not a privacy setting.
This endpoint answers three questions for one store: which mode is in force,
what will actually serve each capability under it, and what is blocked as a
result — the last one matters most, because a shop that switches to
`Local Only` and then finds video narration silently missing deserves to have
been told why beforehand.
