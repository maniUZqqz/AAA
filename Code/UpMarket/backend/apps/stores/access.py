"""Who may do what inside a store.

Until this module existed, every view asked the same question the same way:

    get_object_or_404(Store, pk=pk, owner=request.user)

That is a correct answer to "is this my store?" and the only possible answer to
"may my colleague answer customer messages?" was no — one store, one person, one
login shared around the office. The roadmap (§9.10) asks for real roles;
this is where they are decided.

Two deliberate choices:

* **`Store.owner` stays.** It is who pays and who can delete the store, and
  that is not a role — it is the tenant's anchor. Memberships grant access;
  ownership is not one of them.
* **Permissions are checked here, never inline in a view.** Thirty-two call
  sites asked the ownership question directly, and a single missed one is a
  tenant-isolation hole rather than a missing feature. `tests_access.py` fails
  the build if a view goes back to asking on its own.
