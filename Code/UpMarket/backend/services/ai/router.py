"""Task-type → model routing. Never hardcode model names in business logic.

`models_for` returns an ordered list of models that are ACTUALLY installed on
this machine (see services.ai.models_registry): the configured preference
first, then fallbacks. Callers try them in order so one model that does not
fit in VRAM can no longer take a whole feature down (beter.md v2 #3).
