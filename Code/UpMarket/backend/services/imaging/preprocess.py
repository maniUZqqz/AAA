"""
Clean up a store owner's product photo before it is handed to the diffusion
model.

img2img inherits the input's flaws: a small, soft, badly-exposed phone photo
comes back as a big, soft, badly-exposed poster (beter.md v2 #4). Upscaling
and normalising the source first gives the sampler real detail to work with,
which is worth far more than any wording in the prompt.

Everything here is deterministic image processing (Pillow only) — no model,
no network, no extra VRAM.
