"""What this machine actually is.

ROADMAP §8.5: "نباید بر اساس نام مدل یا حدس، ظرفیت را حساب کرد." The capacity
model currently rests on a remembered range of 3–9 minutes of render per second
of video, which is a 3× spread — wide enough that one end of it is a viable
business and the other is not.

This module answers the first half of that ("what hardware is this?"). The
second half — what the hardware actually achieves — is measured per render in
`apps.jobs.metrics`, because a specification sheet has never once predicted how
long Wan 2.2 takes on a particular card with a particular driver.

Every probe here degrades to `None` rather than guessing. A capacity model fed
a fabricated VRAM figure is worse than one that says "unknown", because the
first kind of wrong looks like an answer.
