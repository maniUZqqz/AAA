 * the visitor keeps the clean URL, and Next still gets its segment.
 *
 * `/en/...` passes through untouched. A request that already says `/fa/...`
 * is redirected back to the bare path so the same page never exists at two
 * URLs — duplicate content is the one thing an SEO rewrite must not create.
